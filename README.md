# pong-game
This is a version of pong I have completed in a few days as a beginner. I completed this project on my own without any help except one issue I had with elif statements. 
This is a two player game which uses the w/s and up/down keys to move the paddles on either side of the screen. It is more complex than it seems, the angle of the ball 
after reflection is decided by where the ball hits on the paddle, and uses trigonometry to find the ball x and y speed.
